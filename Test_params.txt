Input paramters for TheriakPTpath (Moynihan and Pattison, 2013), version: EDK20160831
A parameter must begin at the left margin and end with "%" (white space ignored).
Parameters must appear on their unique line numbers (don't move them up or down).

%% Enter starting information
C:\Users\Eric\TheriakDomino\Programs	% Location of Theriak-Domino Programs folder (ending backslash is optional)
therin.txt				% Name of the therin file required by theriak on your system (see theriak.ini for default name)
Test					% Run name (prepended to output files)
Test_therin.txt				% Name of the bulk composition file for your rock (same format as therin)
					  The order of elements must follow this example:
					  SI(67.30)AL(10.29)FE(4.75)MG(2.47)MN(0.11)CA(0.42)NA(0.96)K(2.59)TI(0.79)H(100)O(?)
					  but the values may be in moles or mole % with any number of digits.
42					% Therin header lines (the number of lines above your bulk composition)
tcdb55c2d_AL3trimmed3.txt		% Name of dataset with thermodynamic properties and solution models
TestProfile.txt				% Filename containing garnet compositional data from core to rim
530					% Starting T (degress C) outside of garnet stability field
5000					% Starting P (bars) outside of garnet stability field

%% Enter running conditions
400					% Min temperature for plot displayed during run (degrees C)
700					% Max temperature for plot displayed during run (degrees C)
4000					% Min pressure for plot during run (bars)
10000					% Max pressure for plot during run (bars)
GARNET					% Garnet name in dataset (e.g., GARNET, GT05, etc.).  This is used to fractionate garnet (see "REMOVE" in TD Guide)
100					% Garnet fractionation amount (% removed at each step)
10.0					% Loop step used in search [along loop_length=sqrt((T2-T1)^2+((P2-P1)/30)^2)]
					  Smaller step size approaches true garnet fractionation, 
					  but larger values may produce adequate results in less time.
0.001					% Spessartine cutoff value.  If the model value drops
					  below this value, the misfit function will exclude spessartine
0.0000					% Bulk Mn minimum value.  If the modeled bulk composition value drops
					  below this value, this amount will be be retained in the bulk composition (Andy's idea)
					% Tolerances for the Matlab optimization function (both must be satisfied)
					  See comments in fminsearch.m code and Matlab help for more
10.0					%  Function f(x) tolerance applies to the difference in misfit values (Matlab default: 0.0001)
10.0					%  Variable x tolerance applies to the distance between PT coordinates (Matlab default: 0.0001)
iter					% Choose to display optimization output ("iter" = on, "off" = off)
0					% Display a figure that shows the candidate PT coordinates during the search 
					  (0 = no, 1 = yes). Calcluations will be slower.

%% Choose saving conditions
allCompsForTD.txt			% Output filename for all bulk compositions along the P-T path
allInfoFromNode.csv			% Output filename for all P, T, bulk comp, garnet comp, etc.
0					% Save the loop fractionation table from each step (0 = no, 1 = yes)
1					% Make one loop fractionation table for the whole PT path (runs after all PT points determined).  Ignores bulk Mn minimum.  This option adds G-garnet to output table.
0					% Make a Theria_g file (0 = no, 1 = yes)
theriag_PTt.txt				% Theria_g filename
saved_workspace.mat			% Name for saving the workspace

%% Choose a version of the misfit function
% To use the same function as Moynihan and Pattison (2013), 
% use all four garnet endmembers and normalize the function.

% Choose only one of the following (0 = no, 1 = yes)
1					% Use Xalm, Xprp, Xgrs, and Xsps
0					% Use Mg# (Mg/Mg+Fe), Xgrs, and Xsps
0					% Use Fe# (Fe/Mg+Fe), Xgrs, and Xsps
0					% Use Xalm, Xprp, and Xgrs
0					% Use Xalm, Xprp, and Xsps (ignores low Xsps cutoff)
0					% Use Xprp and Xgrs
0					% Use Xsps and Xgrs (ignores low Xsps cutoff)
0					% Use only the differences between modeled and observed Xalm, Xprp, Xgrs, and Xsps

% Choose to normalize differences in observed and modeled values (or just use absolute differences)
1					% Normalize the values (0 = no, 1 = yes)

%% These file names do not need to be edited, but you can if you want to.  They will be overwritten repeatedly during the run.
ThkTab.csv				% Name of the loop table file used (internally) by theriak
					% as specified in theriak.ini (this name must match the one in theriak.ini)
ThkOut.txt				% Name of the output file written by theriak at the end of a calculation.
					% (this name must match the one in theriak.ini)
PTloopfrac.txt				% Name of the file that contains the commands used (internally)
					% by theriak during the run
